        gorgeous girl I have ever known and yep I wanna protect at any cost but that 
        is not everything behind why I wanna call her 'My Vanessa', Have you ever seen
        a butterfly flap it's wings or sit on a flower or do whatever it is doin,
        It brings out some inner joy within me and that automatically makes me happy
        'She is just like a butterfly to me' she makes me wanna smile whenever I look at 
        her and It feels like all my worries have suddenly disappear whenever I look at 
        her and whenever she smiles Ooooo my I would die happily watching her smile 
        It is just so pure and elegant that I have no words to describe it, all I wanna
        do is make her smile whenever I can (I'm blushing while imagining you smile).""")

st.write("""We all appreciate butterflies for their beauty and elegance but did you think
        about all the Growth and transformation It went through to reach that form of hers
        well I don't know all of her struggles but I do know a few of them and I love her 
        for not just goin through them but coming out of them and significantly growing 
        as she undergoes through a hardship, can I withstand a pain which is so harsh on 
        me that It hurts like death every month? HELL NAHH I can never do that at all, If it
        happened to me at least once in my life then I'd be crying about for the rest of my 
        life but she goes through it every month without a break and all she tells me 'I can 
        handle this, it ain't even a big deal' My Vanessa please let me help you ease out the
        pain, I'd do anything I can just so that the pain reduces even a lil and did you think 
        that her worries end there? hahahaha nope she has to go through all the things which 
        I go through or even worse and she doesn't even complain about it? 'She is the bravest'
        so I heard that making someone feel joy from within makes their pain go away by just a
        little therefore I started takin her out and made sure she experienced new things like
        freely roaming on a scooty, even if I dont have the best voice out there if she likes to
        hear me then I will definitely sing for her by remembering songs, I would tie her shoe lace, 
        I'd swipe off sweat from her face, adjust her hair, give her flowers, run to the canteen to 
        get her something I know all of these are like small things which even she herself can do 
        but if I can even help her a lil then I would ofc do it no matter how small it is.""")

        for which I have completely fallen in love with which is more gorgeous!""")
